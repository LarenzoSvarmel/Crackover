# CrossOver (De-Trial'd)
Credit goes to [ellsies](https://gist.github.com/ellsies)

(The script isn't modified, at all. You can eye-for-eye the [revisions](https://gist.github.com/ellsies/e9383c75fd8cd8d5781dac91d7e2360d/revisions) of the original creator and clearly see that, and I don't think I'll ever modify the code; If it ain't broke, don't fix it.)

# HOW TO USE
Open Terminal on Mac (LaunchPad -> Search -> Terminal)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LarenzoSvarmel/Crackover/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```
If you're having trouble with pidof, install macports at https://www.macports.org/install.php then use: 
```sudo port install pidof```
